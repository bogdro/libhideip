This is the README file for LibHideIP, a library which
 hides your local IP address from programs.

================================================================

Requirements for compiling:

- a working C compiler (C++ compilers won't work due to variable casts)
- development package for the C library (like glibc-devel and glibc-headers)
- libdl, the dynamic loading library, with its development package
  (unless the required functions are in the C library)
- the 'make' program

Type
	./configure
to configure the library for your system.

Type
	make

to compile the library.

Type
	make install

to install the library.

NOTE: 'make install' is NOT recommended. Create and install an RPM package
 instead, if possible.
