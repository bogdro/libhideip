This is the README file for libhideip, a library which
hides your local IP address from programs.

Author: Bogdan Drozdowski, bogdandr @ op . pl
License: GPLv3+

Requirements for compiling:

- a non-root account. Please, NEVER compile or 'make' anything as root.

- a working C compiler

- development package for the C library (like glibc-devel and glibc-headers)

  The sys/stat.h contains functions needed to check an executable's type.
  If it is a symbolic link, libhideip will follow it.

  The dlfcn.h header contains functions needed to call the original functions.
  It has to have RTLD_NEXT defined. Libhideip wouldn't work without this, so
  it won't compile without this.

- libdl, the dynamic loading library, with its development package
  (unless the required functions are in the C library)

- the 'make' program

Type './configure' to configure the program for your system.

Type 'make' to compile the program. LibHideIP assumes that your host has
 maximum 100 aliases and addresses. If you think this number is not enough,
 compile LibHideIP with:
	make CFLAGS='-DLHIP_MAX_HOSTNAMES=n'
 where 'n' is your desired number (10 is minimum).

Documentation comes complied (and can be copied right away), but can be
  changed and recompiled, if you have the 'makeinfo' program
  ('texinfo' package).

Type 'make install' to install the program.

Type 'info libhideip' (after installation) or 'info doc/libhideip.info'
(before installation) to get help on installing and loading the library.

=======================================================

Building an RPM package:

1) copy the libhideip.spec file to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
2) copy the source package libhideip-XX.tar.gz to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
3) type
	rpmbuild -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/libhideip.spec
4) get the rpms from /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 and /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS
