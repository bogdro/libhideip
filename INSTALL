LibHideIP - a library which hides your local IP address from programs.

Requirements for compiling the full version:
- a non-root account. Please, NEVER compile or 'make' anything as root.
- a working C compiler
- development package for the C library (like glibc-devel and glibc-headers)
  with the sys/stat.h and dlfcn.h
- libdl, the dynamic loading library, with its development package
  (unless the required functions are in the C library)
- the 'make' program

Type './configure' to configure the library for your system.
If you want to enable the public interface of LibHideIP, configure the
 library with
	./configure --enable-public-interface
 The public interface is compatible with SWIG (http://www.swig.org), so
 you can make native bindings to LibHideIP for any supported language.

LibHideIP allows some programs to be banned (not allowed to run under
 LibHideIP, because they might need accesss to the IP address). One banning
 file is always supported - ${sysconfdir}/libhideip.progban (${sysconfdir} is
 /usr/local/etc unless set otherwise during configure).

If you want to disable additional banning files pointed to by environment
 variables, configure the library with
	./configure --enable-environment=no

If you want to disable additional banning files in users' home directories,
 configure the library with
	./configure --enable-user-files=no

Type 'make' to compile the library. LibHideIP assumes that your host has
 maximum 100 aliases and addresses. If you think this number is not enough,
 configure LibHideIP with
	./configure --with-max-host-names=n
 or compile LibHideIP with:
	make CFLAGS='-DLHIP_MAX_HOSTNAMES=n'
 where 'n' is your desired number (10 is minimum).

Documentation will be compiled (and can be copied right away), if you have
  the 'makeinfo' program ('texinfo' package).

Type 'make install' to install the library.

=======================================================

Building an RPM package (the old way):

1) copy the libhideip.spec file to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
2) copy the source package libhideip-XX.tar.gz to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
3) type
	rpmbuild -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/libhideip.spec
4) get the rpms from /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 and /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS

Building an RPM package (the new way):

	rpmbuild -ba $HOME/rpmbuild/SPECS/libhideip.spec
