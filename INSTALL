LibHideIP - a library which hides your local IP address from programs.

Requirements for compiling the full version:
- a non-root account. Please, NEVER compile or 'make' anything as root.
- a working C compiler
- development package for the C library (like glibc-devel and glibc-headers)
- the 'make' program

Type './configure' to configure the library for your system.

Type 'make' to compile the library.
Documentation will be compiled (and can be copied right away), if you have
  the 'makeinfo' program ('texinfo' package).

Type 'make install' to install the library.

=======================================================

Building an RPM package:

1) copy the libhideip.spec file to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
2) copy the source package libhideip-XX.tar.gz to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
3) type
	rpmbuild -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/libhideip.spec
4) get the rpms from /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 and /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS
