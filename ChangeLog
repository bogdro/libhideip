	* libhideip version 0.1
	  Intercepting the following functions: gethostbyaddr, gethostbyaddr_r,
	  gethostbyname, gethostbyname_r, gethostbyname2, gethostbyname2_r,
	  gethostent, gethostent_r, getipnodebyaddr, getipnodebyname,
	  getifaddrs, getnameinfo, getaddrinfo, socket, recvmsg, sendmsg,
	  gethostname (lhip_net.c), execve, system (lhip_exec.c), ioctl
	  (lhip_ioctl.c), uname (lhip_uname.c), fopen64, freopen64, open64,
	  openat64, fopen, freopen, open, openat (lhip_opens.c).
	  All these functions could either directly or indirectly (opening
	  files) lead to discovering the local public IP address (not the
	  "127.0.0.1" address, but the external addresses of the machine's
	  network interfaces). Support for banning programs is added - the
	  banned programs get the original results, not hidden.
	  Compiles on OpenBSD.
	* doc: TeXinfo documentation comes compiled, manual page added.
	* README: quick installation guide
	* AUTHORS: authors list
	* libhideip.spec: an RPM spec file - can be used to build RPMs.
