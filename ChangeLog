2011-03-17	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* libhideip version 0.4
	  Run flawfinder, rats and cppcheck on the code and fixed a few
	  performance and syntax problems.
	* src/lhip_net.c (getsockname): fixed syntax error.
	* src/lhip_priv.h: blocking opening /dev/net*, /dev/tcp*, /dev/udp*,
	  fixed declarations for C++.
	* README: added the glibc license block. Updated RPM creating.
	* libhideip.spec.in: added README, COPYING, AUTHORS and ChangeLog
	  to the RPM package.
	* src/lhip_pcap.c, src/lhip_main.c: blocking libpcap functions.
	* doc/libhideip.texi.in: updated RPM creating and the list of blocked
	  functions.
	* configure.ac: fixed double CFLAGS on compile
	* src/lhip_addr.c: separated address checking from the main file.

2010-05-22	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* libhideip version 0.3
	  Upgrade to newer autotools, gcc and libtool. Added some copyright
	  notices when using code from the GNU C library. Run flawfinder on
	  the code and changed some parts according to the result. Fixed
	  compiling on non-ANSI-C compilers.
	* configure.ac: added AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR, recommended by libtoolize.
	  Added checks for headers related to network name resolving.
	* src/lhip_ioctl.c (ioctl): fixed signed/unsigned variable problem.
	  Added some untested Solaris support.
	* src/lhip_cfg.h.in: enabled HAVE_OPENAT*.
	* src/lhip_exec.c: forbid executing more programs: "ntop", anything
	  with "sniff" or "shark" (like Wireshark) in name. Changed "tcpdump"
	  to "tcp" in banning, to match more programs.
	* src/lhip_net.c (socket): forbid creating raw and packet sockets.
	* src/randomize_names*: added name randomization scripts from LibSecRm,
	  to allow easier hiding of LibHideIP's functions' names (to prevent
	  detecting LibHideIP).
	* src/lhip_net.c (getnameinfo): now checking also for the zero address
	  and all detected local addresses.
	* src/lhip_net.c (bind): new function to prevent guessing the local
	  address by attempting to bind to all posiible addresses in turn.
	* src/lhip_net.c (getsockname): new function to prevent from getting
	  the local address from an already-created socket.
	* src/lhip_net.c (getsockopt, setsockopt): new functions to prevent
	  from getting the local address from a socket by reading its options.
	* src/lhip_net.c (socketpair): new function to prevent from creating
	  raw sockets that could lead to revealing the local address.
	* src/lhip_main.c (__lhip_is_local_addr): fixed comparing IPv4
	  addresses with IPv6 addresses.
	* src/lhip_net.c: fixed problems when memcpy() isn't available.
	* src/lhip_exec.c (system): fixed too small buffer allocated.
	* src/lhip_net.c (getifaddrs): checking network mask and broadcast
	  addresses for NULL and checking their type before changing data.
	* src/lhip_opens.c, src/lhip_exec.c: zeroing buffers for file names.
	* src/lhip_priv.h: defined LHIP_MIN, LHIP_MAX, LHIP_MAXPATHLEN
	  LHIP_ANSIC (for function prototypes) here.
	* doc/libsecrm.texi.in: added one more limitation of LibHideIP.
	  Updated information how to hide LibHideIP.
	* src/lhip_resolve.c: new file that blocks name resolving functions
	  for localhost/localdomain.
	* libhideip.spec.in: corrected warnings displayed by rpmlint.

2009-02-16	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* libhideip version 0.2
	  Renamed PATH_SEP to LHIP_PATH_SEP to avoid conflicts.
	* README, INSTALL, doc/libhideip.texi.in: small update.
	* libhideip.spec.in: fixed the version number.
	* src/lhip_exec.c: forbid executing more programs: "arp", "netstat",
	  anything with "domainname" in name, "ipmaddr", anything with "mii"
	  in name, "route", "ifdown", "ifup", "iftop", "tcpdump", anything
	  with "ppp" in name, anything with "isdn" in name, "ssh", "telnet",
	  "rsh". Forbid reading of files with "mactab" in name.
	* src/lhip_opens.c, src/lhip_ioctl.c: better checking for
	  stdarg.h/varargs.h.

2008-12-23	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* libhideip version 0.1
	  Intercepting the following functions: gethostbyaddr, gethostbyaddr_r,
	  gethostbyname, gethostbyname_r, gethostbyname2, gethostbyname2_r,
	  gethostent, gethostent_r, getipnodebyaddr, getipnodebyname,
	  getifaddrs, getnameinfo, getaddrinfo, socket, recvmsg, sendmsg,
	  gethostname (lhip_net.c), execve, system (lhip_exec.c), ioctl
	  (lhip_ioctl.c), uname (lhip_uname.c), fopen64, freopen64, open64,
	  openat64, fopen, freopen, open, openat (lhip_opens.c).
	  All these functions could either directly or indirectly (opening
	  files) lead to discovering the local public IP address (not the
	  "127.0.0.1" address, but the external addresses of the machine's
	  network interfaces). Support for banning programs is added - the
	  banned programs get the original results, not hidden.
	  Compiles on OpenBSD.
	* doc: TeXinfo documentation comes compiled, manual page added.
	* README: quick installation guide
	* AUTHORS: authors list
	* libhideip.spec: an RPM spec file - can be used to build RPMs.
